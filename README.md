A web-based application that leverages deep learning to detect and classify diseases in black pepper leaves while providing eco-friendly treatment recommendations. This project combines state-of-the-art machine learning with a user-friendly interface to help farmers and agriculturists maintain healthy black pepper crops.

## üåü Features

- **Accurate Disease Detection**: Utilizes ResNet18 architecture for reliable disease classification
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant processing and results for uploaded leaf images
- **Eco-friendly Treatments**: Provides organic and sustainable treatment recommendations
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean, responsive web interface for easy access
- **Confidence Scoring**: Transparent prediction confidence levels
- **Multiple Disease Classification**:
  - Healthy Leaves
  - Leaf Blight
  - Yellow Mottle Virus

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 14.0 or higher
- npm or yarn
- Git

## üöÄ Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LAHI-RU/Black-Pepper-Leaf-Disease-Detection.git
cd Black-Pepper-Leaf-Disease-Detection
```

### Backend Setup
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download model (if not included in repository)
mkdir -p models
# Place the black_pepper_model.pth in the models directory
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

## üéØ Running the Application

### Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Start Frontend Development Server
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
